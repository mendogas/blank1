# Gorilla vs Humans (Unreal Engine) — Tutorial Project

This repository contains my Unreal Engine project completed by following the provided tutorial, plus the required additional tasks.

## What is implemented

### Tutorial
- Core gameplay from the tutorial: gorilla player character vs. human enemies.
- Basic combat / hit / damage flow as in the tutorial.
- (Blood VFX) The paid VFX part from the tutorial was skipped. I used simpler effects where needed.

### Additional tasks
- **Health Pickups**
  - Health pickups spawn occasionally during gameplay.
- **Level Completion Timer**
  - A timer tracks how long it takes to finish the level and is displayed in the UI.

### Bonus (optional)
- **Wave / Round System**: **Not implemented**  

## Notes / Known limitations
- This is a learning project based on a tutorial, so some Blueprint names and/or placement are not perfectly structured yet.
- Generated Unreal folders (`Saved`, `Intermediate`, `DerivedDataCache`) are intentionally not stored in the repository.
